## Part 1: Understanding Agent Architecture (10 minutes)

### The Three Pillars of Strands Agents

Every Strands agent is built on three fundamental components:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Model] --> D[Agent]
    B[Tools] --> D
    C[System Prompt] --> D
    D --> E[User Interaction]
```

#### 1. **Model**: The AI Brain
The model is the core intelligence of your agent. It processes inputs, makes decisions, and generates responses.

```python
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "sk-insecure",  # Dummy key for local models
        "base_url": MODEL_RUNNER_URL  # Docker Model Runner endpoint
    },
    model_id="ai/gemma3:1B-Q4_K_M",  # Local model identifier
    params={
        "temperature": 0.1,  # Lower = more deterministic
        "max_tokens": 500    # Response length limit
    }
)
```

#### 2. **Tools**: Agent Capabilities
Tools extend your agent's abilities beyond text generation. They're Python functions that the agent can call.

```python
from strands import tool

@tool
def current_time(timezone: str = "UTC") -> str:
    """Get the current time in a specific timezone."""
    from datetime import datetime
    import pytz
    
    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
    current = datetime.now(tz)
    return current.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z")
```

#### 3. **System Prompt**: Agent Personality and Instructions
The system prompt defines how your agent behaves, what it knows, and how it should use its tools.

```python
system_prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant with access to real-time information.

## Tool Usage Guidelines
- Use current_time() when user asks about time, date, or 'now'
- For specific timezones, use current_time(timezone='<timezone>')
- Always call current_time when time/date is relevant to the question

## Response Rules
1. Be concise but informative
2. Use tools when appropriate
3. Present information in user-friendly format
"""
```

### Putting It All Together

```python
from strands import Agent

agent = Agent(
    model=model,           # The AI brain
    tools=[current_time],  # Available capabilities
    system_prompt=system_prompt  # Behavior instructions
)

# Use the agent
response = agent("What time is it in Tokyo?")
print(response)
```

## Part 2: Docker Model Runner Integration (15 minutes)

### Why Docker Model Runner?

Docker Model Runner provides several key benefits:
- **Local execution**: No API keys or internet required
- **OpenAI compatibility**: Works with existing OpenAI-based code
- **Model management**: Automatic downloading and caching
- **Resource control**: Configurable memory and CPU usage

### Configuration in Docker Compose

The magic happens in your `compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
services:
  agent:
    build: .
    # Docker AI Platform Integration
    models:
      llm:  # Logical name for the model service
        endpoint_var: MODEL_RUNNER_URL    # Environment variable for API endpoint
        model_var: MODEL_RUNNER_MODEL     # Environment variable for model name

# Model specification
models:
  llm:
    model: ai/gemma3:1B-Q4_K_M  # Model to download and run
    context_size: 8192          # Token limit for conversations
```

### How It Works

1. **Docker Compose** reads the model specification
2. **Docker Model Runner** downloads the model (first run only)
3. **Model Runner** starts an OpenAI-compatible API server
4. **Your agent** connects to the local API endpoint
5. **Environment variables** provide connection details automatically

### Available Models

| Model | Size | Best For | Speed |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `ai/gemma3:1B-Q4_K_M` | ~1GB | Quick responses, simple tasks | Fast |
| `ai/qwen3:1.5B-Q4_K_M` | ~1.5GB | General purpose, good balance | Medium |
| `ai/llama3.2:3B-Q4_K_M` | ~3GB | Complex reasoning, detailed responses | Slower |

## Part 3: Building Your First Agent (15 minutes)

Let's build a practical agent step by step. We'll create a "Research Assistant" that can search for information and save findings.

### Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure

```bash
mkdir my-research-agent
cd my-research-agent
```

### Step 2: Create the Dependencies File

Create `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "research-agent"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "strands",
    "strands-tools",
    "requests",
    "pytz"
]

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

### Step 3: Implement the Agent

Create `agent.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Research Assistant Agent

This agent can search for information and save research findings.
It demonstrates core Strands concepts with practical functionality.
"""

# Configuration
MODEL_RUNNER_URL = os.getenv("MODEL_RUNNER_URL", "http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/llama.cpp/v1")
MODEL_RUNNER_MODEL = os.getenv("MODEL_RUNNER_MODEL", "ai/gemma3:1B-Q4_K_M")
RESEARCH_TOPIC = os.getenv("RESEARCH_TOPIC", "artificial intelligence trends 2024")

@tool
def search_information(query: str) -> str:
    """Search for information about a topic. Returns relevant information."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call a search API
    # For this example, we'll return mock data
    mock_results = {
        "artificial intelligence": "AI is rapidly advancing with developments in large language models, computer vision, and robotics. Key trends include multimodal AI, edge computing integration, and ethical AI frameworks.",

def save_research(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
    """Save research findings to a file."""
    try:
        # Ensure the research directory exists
        os.makedirs("/app/research", exist_ok=True)
        
        filepath = f"/app/research/{filename}"
        with open(filepath, "w") as f:
            f.write(content)

    try:
        print("üîÑ Starting research...")
        response = agent(research_prompt)

        print("üí° Check that Docker Model Runner is available and the model is loaded")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 4: Create the Dockerfile

Create `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.12 slim image for efficiency
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Prevent Python from buffering stdout/stderr
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install uv for fast Python package management
RUN pip install uv

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency specification
COPY pyproject.toml ./

# Install Python dependencies
RUN uv pip install --system .

# Copy application code
COPY agent.py .

# Create research output directory
RUN mkdir -p /app/research

# Run the agent
CMD ["python", "agent.py"]
```

### Step 5: Create Docker Compose Configuration

Create `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
# Research Assistant Agent - Docker Compose Configuration
services:
  research-agent:
    build: .
    
    # Environment variables
    environment:
      - RESEARCH_TOPIC=artificial intelligence trends 2024
    
    # Mount research output directory
    volumes:
      - ./research:/app/research
    
    # Docker AI Platform Integration
    models:
      llm:
        endpoint_var: MODEL_RUNNER_URL
        model_var: MODEL_RUNNER_MODEL
    
    # Development configuration with hot reload
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync+restart
          path: .
          target: /app
          ignore:
            - __pycache__/
            - research/
        - action: rebuild
          path: ./pyproject.toml

# Model configuration
models:
  llm:
    model: ai/gemma3:1B-Q4_K_M
    context_size: 8192
```

### Step 6: Test Your Agent

```bash
# Create the research output directory
mkdir research

# Build and run the agent
docker compose up --build

# Check the saved research
ls -la research/
cat research/*.txt
```

## Part 4: Docker Compose Watch Development Workflow (5 minutes)

### Why Use Docker Compose Watch?

Traditional development cycle:
1. Make code changes
2. Stop container
3. Rebuild image
4. Start container
5. Test changes

With Docker Compose Watch:
1. Make code changes
2. Changes sync automatically
3. Container restarts automatically
4. Test immediately

### Setting Up Watch Mode

Your `compose.yaml` already includes the watch configuration:

```yaml
develop:
  watch:
    - action: sync+restart  # Sync files and restart service
      path: .               # Watch current directory
      target: /app          # Sync to container directory
      ignore:               # Don't sync these
        - __pycache__/
        - research/
    - action: rebuild       # Rebuild on dependency changes
      path: ./pyproject.toml
```

### Using Watch Mode

```bash
# Start in watch mode
docker compose watch

# Now make changes to agent.py - the container will restart automatically
# Try changing the system prompt or adding a new tool
```

### Watch Mode Best Practices

1. **Ignore output directories**: Don't sync generated files back to host
2. **Rebuild on dependency changes**: Watch `pyproject.toml` for new packages
3. **Use sync+restart for code**: Faster than full rebuilds
4. **Monitor logs**: Watch the output to see when restarts happen

## Hands-On Exercise: Enhance Your Agent

Now it's your turn! Enhance the research agent with additional functionality:

### Exercise 1: Add a Calculator Tool

Add this tool to your agent:

```python
@tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    """Safely calculate mathematical expressions."""
    try:
        # Simple validation - only allow basic math
        allowed_chars = set('0123456789+-*/.() ')
        if not all(c in allowed_chars for c in expression):
            return "Error: Only basic math operations allowed"
        
        result = eval(expression)
        return f"Calculation: {expression} = {result}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Calculation error: {e}"
```

### Exercise 2: Modify the Research Topic

Change the environment variable and test:

```bash
RESEARCH_TOPIC="quantum computing applications" docker compose up --build
```

### Exercise 3: Experiment with Models

Try different models by editing `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  llm:
    model: ai/qwen3:1.5B-Q4_K_M  # Try this larger model
    context_size: 8192
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Agent Architecture**: Model + Tools + System Prompt = Powerful AI Agent
2. **Docker Integration**: Model Runner makes local AI development seamless
3. **Development Workflow**: Compose Watch enables rapid iteration
4. **Tool Design**: Well-documented tools with clear purposes work best
5. **Error Handling**: Always include try/catch blocks and helpful error messages

## Next Steps

In Module 3, you'll learn to:
- Integrate real external APIs using MCP Gateway
- Implement secure credential management
- Build more sophisticated tool chains
- Handle complex agent interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent won't start:**
- Check Docker Desktop is running with AI features
- Verify model is downloading: `docker compose logs`

**Tools not working:**
- Ensure tool functions have proper `@tool` decorator
- Check tool docstrings are descriptive
- Verify tools are added to agent's tools list

**Model responses are poor:**
- Try adjusting temperature (0.1 = deterministic, 0.7 = creative)
- Improve system prompt with more specific instructions
- Consider using a larger model

**Hot reload not working:**
- Ensure you're using `docker compose watch`
- Check file paths in watch configuration
- Verify files aren't being ignored
